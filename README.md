# ALIEN INVASION

## A practice project from the book Python Crash Course with Eric Matthes

## Program Description

In _Alien Invasion_, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys an shoot bullets using the spacebar.

When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. 

If the player destroys all the aliens, a anew fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleeet. 

If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the sceen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
